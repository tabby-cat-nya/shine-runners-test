# Testing

## Adding test

Use "assert_eq" for "primitive" values and "assert_eq_deep" for complex data

For add some test be sure:
1. Your test are inside /test folder
2. Your test file starts with test name
3. Your test script extends from "GutTest"
4. Your test methods starts also with test

You can use some useful methods for testing like:
* before_all -> Excecuted before all tests in the script
* before_each -> Excecuted before each test in the script
* after_each -> Excecuted after each test in the script
* after_all -> Excecuted after all tests in the script
